          <p>The International Conference on Industrial and Logistics Systems (SIL) is a multidisciplinary event that brings together researchers, academics, and industry professionals who share an interest in the fields of Industrial and Logistics Engineering. The conference serves as a platform for discussing and exchanging ideas on the design, optimization, improvement, restructuring, and performance evaluation of industrial and logistics systems in a broad sense.
            SIL primarily focuses on four complementary perspectives of industrial and logistics systems: the Operational perspective, the Informational perspective, the Technological perspective, and the Decision-Making perspective, which is increasingly supported by emerging technologies.</p>
          <h5 class="dash-style">ABOUT SIL'25</h5>
          <p>The 8th edition of SIL (SIL'25) places a particular emphasis on research related to the Digital Transformation in Automotive and Aeronautical Supply Chains. Given the increasing complexity and globalization of these sectors, the conference will highlight approaches that leverage emerging technologies to improve resilience, agility, and efficiency in supply chain operations. Research contributions and professional applications aligned with this theme will be especially valued.</p>

          <p>This book aims to provide recent achievements in the efficient design and operation of industrial and logistics systems. To achieve excellence, digital transformation is currently an essential path for systems reengineering. This path is still in an exploratory phase for industrial and logistics systems, as they cover a wide range of sectors and are composed of several complementary views. Thus, this book reconciles classic methods with modern ones based on digital transformation and Industry 4.0 technologies, which aim to optimize, improve, restructure, and evaluate a broad scope of systems, focusing on their four complementary views: operational, informational, technological, and decisional. It is intended for researchers and postgraduates in industrial engineering and logistics, professionals in senior management positions in industrial and logistics companies, as well as undergraduates in industrial and logistics engineering programs.
